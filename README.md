# NexEntry 🚀

Welcome to **NexEntry**! This is a comprehensive User Authentication & Profile Management System I built to demonstrate a full-stack PHP application.

### 👋 About The Project
I wanted to create a login system that isn't just secure but also feels great to use. NexEntry handles the core flows of **Registration**, **Login**, and **Profile Management** seamlessly. It's designed with a modern, responsive UI that adapts to your preference (Dark Mode included! 🌙).

### 🛠️ How It Works
Under the hood, I'm using a hybrid database approach to showcase different technologies:
*   **MySQL**: securely stores user credentials (username, email, and hashed passwords).
*   **MongoDB**: handles the flexible user profile data (Age, DOB, Address, Contact).
*   **Redis**: manages active user sessions for lighting-fast authentication check.
*   **PHP**: powers the backend logic.
*   **AWS EC2**: handles the live hosting on an Ubuntu server.

### ✨ Live Demo
You can check out the live version running on an AWS EC2 instance here:

### 🚀 Key Features
*   **Secure Authentication**: Password hashing and session management.
*   **Smart Forms**: Auto-validating inputs (like international phone numbers).
*   **Theme Support**: Toggle between Dark and Light modes.
*   **Profile Persistence**: Your data is saved and automatically reloaded when you return.

Feel free to explore the code!
